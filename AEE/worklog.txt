Work Log:

- February 14th -
Creation of project based on 348 Term project began.
Started because I felt I needed more use in c++ and also the project seemed interesting
despite how tough the workload might seem due to a whole team working on it for 348.
Basic Binary Node completed

- Februaury 15th -
Began working on the Binary Expression Tree class to deal with the expressions with a private root value initialized and a "sortExpression" function began
implementation did not take into might PEMDAS and was incredibly poorly designed with many syntax errors and assumptions with how specific classes functioned
started AddExpression Fork for this.

- February 16th -
Rewrote the sortExpression code and added evaluator function in hopes of working on the many mistakes made prior.
After realization that PEMDAS wasn't taken into account removed all of the code and created a fork for a function prefix
that would convert infix to prefix and make that easier to convert into nodes

- February  17th -
Sorting exppression into tree changed AGAIN to be similar to the first one while taking into account PEMDAS and precedence
to make it simpler and learning more about <string>, <vector>, and many other library headers in order to improve code.

- February 18th -
Continue working on expression tree.

- February 19th -
Time to begin testing

-February 27th-
Oops deleted all of 18th and 19th data, Project not complete, some issue with subtraction...

-March 2nd-
Fixed major issues

-March 3rd-
Went through everything and made the header file, last thing to work on should be errors
series of debugging and finding issues gosh


-March 8th-
Complete Development for now, Plans to begin working on Error Checking later, 
added support:
	Implicit Use of powers 2^-1 = .05, 2^+2 = 4
	Factorials 3! = 6
	Implicit sub/add 1++1 = 2, 1-+-1 = 0
